# S2I Builder with Gradle and Java

A very simple S2I builder which builds Java applications with Gradle.
Mainly useful for single-JAR applications like Spring Boot.

For a very similar S2I Java builder with some more options and flexibility, consider [fabric8io-images/s2i](https://github.com/fabric8io-images/s2i), AKA [fabric8/s2i-java on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fabric8/s2i-java/).
It [includes support for Gradle and Java 11 in addition to Maven and Java 8 as per this blog post](http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2018/11/s2i-with-java-11-gradle-builds-for.html).
